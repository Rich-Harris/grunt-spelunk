grunt-spelunk
=============

Grunt task to traverse a folder and flatten it to a JSON representation

This project doesn't exist yet... it's just here so that the link on [spelunk](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/spelunk) goes somewhere. In the meantime you can use [grunt-dir2json](https://github.com/GuardianInteractive/grunt-dir2json) which is the same thing except a bit crappier.
